# Chapter 4

Planned analysis for chapter 4: Serological investigation of Lassa mammarenavirus among rodent species in Eastern Sierra Leone.

## Project structure

### Data

All data required to reproduce the analysis will be stored in `input`.

**Rodent data:** Cleaned rodent data will be obtained from [`rodent_trapping.Rproj`](https://github.com/DidDrog11/rodent_trapping).

**Serological data:** Data will be obtained by analysis of rodent samples in (`SL_lassa_ELISA.Rproj`)[https://github.com/DidDrog11/SL_lassa_ELISA].

### Code

Code can be run from the `main.R` script which will organise the functions and scripts used to conduct the analysis.

Scripts and functions will be contained in the `R` folder.

### Output

Plots and accompanying data will be produced and stored in an `output` folder at the point in which they are created. These will be subsequently imported into the report.

The manuscript or report will be stored in a `report` folder. This will be written as an `.Rmd` that can be produced as a`.docx` or `.pdf` file.

## Project aims

1.  Which rodent species in a Lassa fever endemic region display evidence of prior infection with *Lassa mammarenavirus*?
2.  Is seroprevalence increased in rodent networks containing *Mastomys natalensis*?
3.  What is the role of diverse or depauparate rodent assemblages on risk an individual rodents risk of prior infection with *Lassa mammarenavirus*?

Trapped an area
Identified the occurrence of a rodent
Produced a network of rodents trapped in the same spatial and temporal activity
Identified the potential contacts of that rodent
Investigated the difference between landuse types
Tested these rodents for antibodies
Described the networks of those with evidence of infection

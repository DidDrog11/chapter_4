	abstract = {As part of a large survey on reservoirs of Lassa fever in Guinea, three villages were investigated in high endemic zone, close to Sierra Leone border. Biodiversity of the small mammal community is presented in this study through a standardized trapping in houses, cultivations and forest. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology and by molecular technique for sibling species. Of the 1123 specimens collected in 2003–2005, we identified seventeen species (thirteen Muridae, four Soricidae), leading to high diversity (Shannon index = 1.6–1.8) and high equitability (evenness index = 0.7–0.8) in cultivations and forest. In houses conversely, the rodent community was dominated by Mastomys natalensis (95–98\%), leading to low diversity and equitability. Dynamics and reproduction were investigated in two species of pygmy mice, Mus mattheyi and Mus minutoides, two species of Praomys, P. daltoni and P. rostratus, and in Mastomys erythroleucus. The pygmy mice were abundant in cultivations in early rainy season, and reproduced from rainy to dry season. Praomys daltoni was also found more abundant in cultivations and seemed to reproduce between rainy and dry season, whereas P. rostratus preferred forest and cultivations in late rainy season, and reproduced throughout the year. Finally, M. erythroleucus was more abundant in forest in dry season, and seemed to reproduce from late rainy to dry season. This species had a low occurrence (6.5\%) in the Faranah’s zone, and probably lived at its southern limit in Guinea. The presence of other Murinae, such as M. natalensis, Praomys spp as possible competitors in the same habitats, is discussed. For the first time, this study relates population biology of pygmy mice with molecular identification.},

	shorttitle = {Chapter 5 - Lassa Fever},
	abstract = {Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever, caused by an arenavirus discovered in 1969 in Nigeria. Nosocomial outbreaks and high seroprevalences have been recorded in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. After 7–10 days of incubation, humans develop fever, malaise, headache, myalgias and sore throat, although most have no recognized symptoms. Acute cases with diarrhea, edema and bleeding from mucosal surfaces affect 0.5\% of the human population, with death occurring 10–15 days after onset. The disease has two geographically endemic areas separated by 2000 km with little evidence of virus circulation in Benin, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. The reservoir is the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, a rodent widely distributed in Africa. In West Africa, this species is mainly commensal, with populations fluctuating over time and space in rural localities. They are more abundant inside human habitation during the dry season than during the rainy season, increasing the risk of transmission to humans in the dry season. People living in villages are infected by contact with rodent excreta, or by inhaling viral particles. There is also evidence of human-to-human transmission in rural and urban localities. A human-to-rodent transmission is also discussed in this chapter as a consequence of the virus excretion in human saliva and urine, and the virus surviving outside the host. The genome of Lassa virus is bisegmented, with a small fragment coding for the glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein, and a long segment coding for the polymerase and the matrix protein. Today, 11 strains are completely sequenced, and phylogenies reveal large virus diversity in Nigeria with three lineages, while only one exists in Sierra Leone-Guinea-Liberia. Another lineage from Ghana-Côte d’Ivoire-Mali would be intermediate. The phylogeny reveals that Lassa virus emerged 700–900 years ago in Nigeria and then in Sierra Leone 150–200 years ago. This time scale does not support the co-evolution concept since M. natalensis emerged 2.3 million years ago. Recent findings such as new arenaviruses in other African rodents and in snakes argue preferably toward the host-switching concept. The recent emergence in Sierra Leone, the absence of virus positive Mastomys between the two endemic zones and poor virus diversity in the Mano River area point in the direction of a unique import of Lassa virus from Nigeria to Sierra Leone during the 19th century. The hypothesis of human displacements through the Atlantic slave trade and its abolition in 1807 concludes this chapter.},

Viral infection of Mastomys from houses ranged from 0\% to 80\%. The incidence of seroconversions in susceptible persons ranged from 5\% to 22\% per year; the ratio of illness to infection ranged from 9\% to 26\%, and the proportion of febrile illness associated with seroconversion was 5\%-14\%. Eightfold rises in titer of antibody occurred in 1\%-18\% of the antibody-positive population, a result suggesting reinfection. We estimate the ratio of fatalities to infection to be 1\%-2\%, a rate lower than estimates based on hospitalized cases. The high incidence of Lassa fever makes it a major problem in West Africa.},

The analysis showed an overall strengthening of the outbreaks, hallmarked by the change from irregular to regular annual and from limited local to nationwide outbreaks, while there was a sharp contrast between the upward trend in case numbers and downward trend in case fatality.

The cowpox virus is a zoonosis which circulates in these rodent hosts and has been shown to have an adverse effect on reproductive output. The transmission dynamics within species is best described as frequency dependent rather than density dependent, contrary to the ‘mass action’ assumption of most previous studies, both theoretical and empirical. Estimation of a transmission coefficient for each species in each population also allows annual and seasonal variations in transmission dynamics to be investigated through an analysis of regression residuals. Transmission between host species is found to be negligible despite their close co–habitation. The consequences of this for the combining ability of hosts as zoonotic reservoirs, and for apparent competition between hosts, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever ({LF}) is a viral hemorrhagic disease found in Sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for up to 300,000 cases and 5000 deaths annually. {LF} is highly endemic in Sierra Leone, particularly in its Eastern Province. Kenema Government Hospital ({KGH}) maintains one of only a few {LF} isolation facilities in the world with year-round diagnostic testing. Here we focus on space-time trends for {LF} occurring in Sierra Leone between 2012 and 2019 to provide a current account of {LF} in the wake of the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic. Data were analyzed for 3277 suspected {LF} cases and classified as acute, recent, and non-{LF} or prior {LF} exposure using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ({ELISAs}). Presentation rates for acute, recent, and non-{LF} or prior {LF} exposure were 6.0\% (195/3277), 25.6\% (838/3277), and 68.4\% (2244/3277), respectively. Among 2051 non-{LF} or prior {LF} exposures, 33.2\% (682/2051) tested positive for convalescent {LF} exposure. The overall {LF} case-fatality rate ({CFR}) was 78.5\% (106/135). Both clinical presentations and confirmed {LF} cases declined following the Ebola epidemic. These declines coincided with an increased duration between illness onset and clinical presentation, perhaps suggesting more severe disease or presentation at later stages of illness. Acute {LF} cases and their corresponding {CFRs} peaked during the dry season (November to April). Subjects with recent (but not acute) {LF} exposure were more likely to present during the rainy season (May to October) than the dry season (p {\textless} 0.001). The findings here suggest that {LF} remains endemic in Sierra Leone and that caseloads are likely to resume at levels observed prior to the Ebola epidemic. The results provide insight on the current epidemiological profile of {LF} in Sierra Leone to facilitate {LF} vaccine studies and accentuate the need for {LF} cohort studies and continued advancements in {LF} diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.},

	abstract = {Introduction
: Liberia is endemic to Lassa fever ({LF}) and has the largest reported per capita incidence of {LF} patients in the West African region. Cases of the disease increased unprecedentedly in 2019 and 2020, characterized by a geographical drift in epidemiology and seasonal variation of occurrence. This study aims to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Lassa fever in Liberia from 2019 to 2020.
Method
: A retrospective study was conducted on cases of {LF} confirmed at the National Public Health Reference Laboratory from January 2019 to December 2020. Medical records were reviewed, and epidemiological and clinical data were collected in an organized manner. Descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out using Epi Info (version 7.2.5.0)
Result
: A total of 382 suspected {LF} cases were reported, of which 103 were laboratory-confirmed, yielding a case positivity rate of 27\% (103/382). The median age of the {LF} cases was 20 ({IGR}: 9-30) Children less than 18 years of age accounted for 40.8\% (42/103) of the cases and healthcare workers case constituted 7.7\% of the cases. Bong, Nimba and Grand Bass accounted for 87.4\% of the cases with cases in new counties like Lofa, Margibi and Grand Kru. Hemorrhage ({aOR}:10.2; 95\%{CI}: 3.11-33.81), patients who did not receive ribavirin ({aOR}: 4.4; 95\%{CI}: 1.12-17.57, p=0.034), and aged 40 years or older ({aOR}: 6.2; 95\%{CI}: 1.19-32.53, p=0.049) were associated with Lassa fever mortality.
Conclusion
: The {LF} cases in 2019 and 2020 had a high {CFR} and spread to new counties that had not previously been reporting {LF}. The disease occurred during most part of the raining season outside the usual dry season. There is urgent need to lower morbidity and mortality, improve early presentation to hospital and early initiation of appropriate medical care.},

There was an overall trend toward clearance of virus within 40 days of infection in most organs. The exception is lung specimens, which retained positivity throughout the course of the 85-day study. Direct (contact) and indirect (fomite) transmission experiments demonstrated 40\% of experimentally infected M. natalensis were capable of transmitting {LASV} to naïve animals, with peak transmissibility occurring between 28 and 42 days post-inoculation. No differences in patterns of infection or transmission were noted between male and female experimentally infected rodents. Adult lab-reared M. natalensis are highly susceptible to genetically distinct {LASV} strains developing a temporary asymptomatic infection associated with virus shedding resulting in contact and fomite transmission within a cohort.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever ({LF}) is endemic in West Africa and constitutes a significant public health concern due to its potential for epidemics and associated high mortality. The first reported case and management of Lassa fever in Plateau State occurred more than 50 years ago. We set out to undertake a three-year epidemiological review of {LF} cases in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria. This is a retrospective study of all confirmed {LF} cases in Plateau State between 2016 and 2018. Plateau state Lassa fever- Line list and patient case records were used to extract relevant data. Lassa {PCR} was carried out at the {NCDC} accredited Laboratory network. Data analysis was done using {STATA} version {SE}14.1. Forty-four persons (44) had confirmed {LF} over the examined period, 18 (41\%) in 2016, 15 (34\%) in 2017 and 11 (25\%) in 2018. The mean age was 29.7±14.6 years and 53\% were males. Sixty-six percent (66\%) of the patients resided in rural areas. It affected all local government areas ({LGA}) in the state except Pankshin, Jos East and Kanke {LGAs}. Twenty-five percent (25\%) of the cases occurred among underprivileged communities of Jos North and another 25\% in rural dwellers of Langtang North. Fifty-nine percent (59\%) of cases occurred during the 1st quarter, 27\% the 2nd quarter and 18\% the 3rd quarter of the year. The case fatality rate was 57\%. {LF} is endemic in Plateau State. Prevention strategies must be sustained year round and target the youth, urban and rural underprivileged communities. There is also need for case management improvement to reduce mortality.},

Both radio-tracking and capture–mark–recapture were undertaken simultaneously. Contact networks were derived and the following statistics estimated: mean-contact rate, edge distribution, connectance and centrality. 3. Capture–mark–recapture networks produced more informative and complete networks when the rodent density was high and radio-tracking produced more informative networks when the density was low. Different data collection methods provide more data when certain ecological characteristics of the population prevail. 4. Both sets of data produced networks with comparable edge (contact) distributions that were best described by a negative binomial distribution. Connectance and closeness were statistically different between the two data sets. Only betweenness was comparable. The differences between the networks have important consequences for the transmission of infectious diseases. Care should be taken when extrapolating social networks to transmission networks for inferring disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {Density-dependent shifts in population processes like territoriality, reproduction, dispersal, and parasite transmission are driven by changes in contacts between individuals. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about how contacts change with density, and thus the mechanisms driving density-dependent processes. A simple linear contact–density function is often assumed, but this is not based on a sound basis of empirical data. We addressed this question using a replicated, semi-natural experiment in which we measured contacts at feeding stations between multimammate mice, Mastomys natalensis, across ten distinct, linearly increasing densities between 10 and 272 animals/ha. Unexpectedly, unique contacts increased not linearly but sigmoidally with density, which we attribute to the species’ scramble competition mating system, small-scale dominance/avoidance and absence of territoriality. These results provide new insights into how species’ characteristics can relate to density-dependent changes in contacts, and the unexpected shape of the contact–density function warrants that density-dependence in ecological models, such as parasite transmission models, must be parameterized with care.},

At larger scales, and for bank voles at all scales, cowpox cases showed no spatial clustering beyond that expected from an association with host distribution. 6 Cowpox cases among wood mice showed strong evidence of temporal clustering beyond that of the host population, indicating short-lived outbreaks. No such effect was apparent among bank voles. 7 Significant space–time interaction among cowpox cases was detected at the hypothesized spatial and temporal scales in both host species. This suggests that the risk of transmission is concentrated locally. 8 Results are discussed in terms of transmission, including consideration of the appropriateness of distance and nearest-neighbour based clustering tests to infections transmitted by local density and frequency dependent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Individual- and species-level heterogeneity in contact rates can alter the ability of a pathogen to invade a host community. Many pathogens have multiple modes of transmission—by direct or indirect contact. It is important to identify the role of heterogeneity in different types of transmission when managing the risk of disease spillover at the interface among different host species. We developed a network-based analysis to explore how individual- and species-level heterogeneity shape multi-mode contact networks. We applied this network-based approach to contact data from proximity loggers collected in a multi-species host community that contributes to the spillover of the disease bovine tuberculosis ({bTB}) to cattle populations in Michigan, {USA}. We used this approach to (a) quantify how individual- and species-level heterogeneity influence direct and indirect contacts in this system, (b) explore how management interventions to control spillovers, such as the installation of deer fences, can alter observed contact networks and c) predict the role that wildlife species have in maintaining {bTB} in the community. We found that individual- and species-level heterogeneity disproportionately influenced indirect and direct contact networks, with individual-level heterogeneity having a greater effect on indirect contact networks and species-level heterogeneity having a greater effect on direct contact networks. We also found that the installation of deer fences significantly reduced deer-specific indirect contacts. We used the results from our network analysis to show that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) could act as the sole reservoir host for {bTB} in this community with important implications for understanding past {bTB} dynamics and managing the persistence of {bTB} in the future. Synthesis and applications. Analyses of epidemiological networks rarely account for multiple modes of contact, which can lead to an incomplete understanding of how individual- and species-level heterogeneity affect disease transmission. The multi-mode, multi-species network analysis we develop in this study illustrates that individual- and species-level heterogeneity can play significantly different roles depending on the type of contact network considered. This has important implications when managing disease at the wildlife–livestock interface, where strategies may need to be multi-pronged to account for the variable role of heterogeneity on different modes of contact.},

While contact network studies are becoming more common for wildlife, their methodologies, fundamental assumptions, host species, and parasites vary widely. The goal of this article is to review how contact networks have been used to study macro- and microparasite transmission in wildlife.

To understand disease persistence within these communities, it is essential to know the contribution each host species makes to parasite transmission and maintenance. However, quantifying those contributions is challenging. We present a conceptual framework for classifying multihost sharing, based on key thresholds for parasite persistence. We then develop a generalized technique to quantify each species' contribution to parasite persistence, allowing natural systems to be located within the framework. We illustrate this approach using data on gastrointestinal parasites circulating within rodent communities and show that, although many parasites infect several host species, parasite persistence is often driven by just one host species. In some cases, however, parasites require multiple host species for maintenance. Our approach provides a quantitative method for differentiating these cases using minimal reliance on system-specific parameters, enabling informed decisions about parasite management within poorly understood multihost communities.},

Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneities within disease hosts suggest that not all individuals have the same probability of transmitting disease or becoming infected. This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts. As such, it has been proposed that many host–pathogen systems follow the general pattern whereby a small fraction of the population accounts for a large fraction of the pathogen transmission. This disparity in transmission dynamics is often referred to as ‘20/80 Rule’, i.e. approximately 20 per cent of the hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of pathogen transmission. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in contact rates among potential hosts of a directly transmitted pathogen by examining Sin Nombre virus ({SNV}) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using foraging arenas and powder marking, we documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert, central Utah. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity among deer mice, both in frequency and in duration of contacts with other deer mice. Contact dynamics appear to follow the general pattern that a minority of the population accounts for a majority of the contacts. We found that 20 per cent of individuals in the population were responsible for roughly 80 per cent of the contacts observed. Larger-bodied individuals appear to be the functional group with the greatest {SNV} transmission potential. Contrary to our predictions, transmission potential was not influenced by breeding condition or sex.},

	abstract = {Background The management of many pathogens, which are of concern to humans and their livestock, is complicated by the pathogens' ability to cross-infect multiple host species, including wildlife. This has major implications for the management of such diseases, since the dynamics of infection are dependent on the rates of both intra- and inter-specific transmission. However, the difficulty of studying transmission networks in free-living populations means that the relative opportunities for intra- versus inter-specific disease transmission have not previously been demonstrated empirically within any wildlife-livestock disease system. Methodology/Principal Findings Using recently-developed proximity data loggers, we quantify both intra-and inter-specific contacts in a wildlife-livestock disease system, using bovine tuberculosis ({bTB}) in badgers and cattle in the {UK} as our example. We assess the connectedness of individuals within the networks in order to identify whether there are certain ‘high-risk’ individuals or groups of individuals for disease transmission within and between species. Our results show that contact patterns in both badger and cattle populations vary widely, both between individuals and over time. We recorded only infrequent interactions between badger social groups, although all badgers fitted with data loggers were involved in these inter-group contacts. Contacts between badgers and cattle occurred more frequently than contacts between different badger groups. Moreover, these inter-specific contacts involved those individual cows, which were highly connected within the cattle herd. Conclusions/Significance This work represents the first continuous time record of wildlife-host contacts for any free-living wildlife-livestock disease system. The results highlight the existence of specific individuals with relatively high contact rates in both livestock and wildlife populations, which have the potential to act as hubs in the spread of disease through complex contact networks. Targeting testing or preventive measures at high-contact groups and individuals within livestock populations would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of disease management strategies.},

	abstract = {Wild animals are the source of many pathogens of livestock and humans. Concerns about the potential transmission of economically important and zoonotic diseases from wildlife have led to increased surveillance at the livestock-wildlife interface. Knowledge of the types, frequency and duration of contacts between livestock and wildlife is necessary to identify risk factors for disease transmission and to design possible mitigation strategies. Observing the behaviour of many wildlife species is challenging due to their cryptic nature and avoidance of humans, meaning there are relatively few studies in this area. Further, a consensus on the definition of what constitutes a 'contact' between wildlife and livestock is lacking. A systematic review was conducted to investigate which livestock-wildlife contacts have been studied and why, as well as the methods used to observe each species. Over 30,000 publications were screened, of which 122 fulfilled specific criteria for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of studies examined cattle contacts with badgers or with deer; studies involving wild pig contacts with cattle or with domestic pigs were the next most frequent. There was a range of observational methods including motion-activated cameras and global positioning system collars. As a result of the wide variation and lack of consensus in the definitions of direct and indirect contacts, we developed a unified framework to define livestock-wildlife contacts that is sufficiently flexible to be applied to most wildlife and livestock species for non-vector-borne diseases. We hope this framework will help standardise the collection and reporting of contact data; a valuable step towards being able to compare the efficacy of wildlife-livestock observation methods. In doing so, it may aid the development of better disease transmission models and improve the design and effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent disease transmission.},

We used this framework to quantify the contributions of host species composition and habitat patch identity on the persistence of an amphibian pathogen across the landscape. By sampling over 11 000 hosts of six amphibian species, we found that a single host species could maintain the pathogen in 91\% of observed metacommunities. Moreover, this dominant maintenance species contributed, on average, twice as much to landscape-level pathogen persistence compared to the most influential source patch in a metacommunity. Our analysis demonstrates substantial inequality in how species and patches contribute to pathogen persistence, with important implications for targeted disease management.},

Yet, little is known about the factors shaping contact networks in many wildlife species and how wildlife management actions might affect contact networks. Wild pigs in North America are an invasive, socially structured species that pose a health concern for domestic swine given their ability to transmit numerous devastating diseases such as African swine fever ({ASF}). Using proximity loggers and {GPS} data from 48 wild pigs in Florida and South Carolina, {USA}, we employed a probabilistic framework to estimate weighted contact networks. We determined the effects of sex, social group and spatial distribution (monthly home-range overlap and distance) on wild pig contact. We also estimated the impacts of management-induced perturbations on contact and inferred their effects on {ASF} establishment in wild pigs with simulation. Social group membership was the primary factor influencing contacts. Between-group contacts depended primarily on space use characteristics, with fewer contacts among groups separated by {\textgreater}2 km and no contacts among groups {\textgreater}4 km apart within a month. Modelling {ASF} dynamics on the contact network demonstrated that indirect contacts resulting from baiting (a typical method of attracting wild pigs or game species to a site to enhance recreational hunting) increased the risk of disease establishment by 33\% relative to direct contact. Low-intensity population reduction ({\textless}5.9\% of the population) had no detectable impact on contact structure but reduced predicted {ASF} establishment risk relative to no population reduction. We demonstrate an approach for understanding the relative role of spatial, social and individual-level characteristics in shaping contact networks and predicting their effects on disease establishment risk, thus providing insight for optimizing disease control in spatially and socially structured wildlife species.},

Here, we describe multi-host contact networks and elucidate the potential of disease spread through farms with multiple hosts. Four years of between-farm animal movement among all farms of a Brazilian state were described through a static and monthly snapshot of network representations. We developed a stochastic multilevel model to simulate scenarios in which infection was seeded into single host and multi-host farms to quantify disease spread potential, and simulate network-based control actions used to evaluate the reduction of secondarily infected farms. We showed that the swine network was more connected than cattle and small ruminants in both the static and monthly snapshots. The small ruminant network was highly fragmented, however, contributed to interconnecting farms, with other hosts acting as intermediaries throughout the networks. When a single host was initially infected, secondary infections were observed across farms with all other species. Our stochastic multi-host model demonstrated that targeting the top 3.25\% of the farms ranked by degree reduced the number of secondarily infected farms. The results of the simulation highlight the importance of considering multi-host dynamics and contact networks while designing surveillance and preparedness control strategies against pathogens known to infect multiple species.},

	abstract = {1 Abstract
Rodents are important globally distributed reservoirs of known and novel zoonotic pathogens. Ongoing anthropogenic land use change is altering the composition of host species assemblages and modifying the risk of zoonoses spillover events. These changes mean that an understanding of the current distribution of rodent species is vital for accurately describing disease hazard and managing risk. However, available species distribution and host-pathogen association datasets (e.g. {IUCN}, {GBIF}, {CLOVER}) are often taxonomically and spatially biased. Here, we synthesise data from West Africa from 127 rodent trapping studies, published between 1964-2022, as an additional source of information to characterise the range and presence of important zoonotic pathogen host species in this region. We identify that these rodent trapping studies, although biased towards human dominated landscapes across West Africa, can usefully complement current rodent species distribution datasets and we calculate the discrepancies between these datasets. For five regionally important zoonotic pathogens (Arenaviridae spp., Borrelia spp., Lassa mammarenavirus, Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii), we identify host-pathogen associations that have not been previously reported in host-association datasets. These omissions have the potential for biasing estimates of current risk and drivers of zoonoses. Finally, for these five pathogen groups, we find that the proportion of a rodent hosts range that has been sampled remains small with geographic clustering. A priority of future rodent trapping studies should be to sample rodent hosts across a greater geographic range to better characterise current and future risk of zoonotic spillover events. In the interim, future studies of spatial pathogen risk informed by rodent distributions must incorporate a measure of the current sampling biases. The current synthesis of contextually rich rodent trapping data enriches available information from {IUCN}, {GBIF} and {CLOVER} which can support a more complete understanding of the hazard of zoonotic spillover events.
Author Summary Emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases are projected to have increasing health impacts, particularly under changing climate and land-use scenarios. Rodents carry a disproportionate number of zoonotic pathogens and are abundant across West Africa, raising concerns about increasing outbreaks of endemic disease and the emergence of pandemics. Prior modelling studies rely on large, consolidated data sources which do not incorporate high resolution spatial and temporal data from rodent trapping studies. Here, we synthesise these studies to quantify the bias in the sampling of rodent hosts and their pathogens across West Africa. We find that rodent trapping studies are complementary to these datasets and can provide additional, high-resolution data on the distribution of hosts and their pathogens. Further, rodent trapping studies have identified additional potential host-pathogen associations than are recorded in consolidated host-pathogen association datasets. This can help to understand the risk of zoonotic diseases based on host distributions. Finally, we quantify the current extent of known rodent presence and pathogen sampling within a species range, highlighting that current knowledge is limited across much of the region. We hope that this will support work to study rodent hosts and their pathogens in currently under sampled regions to better understand the risk of emerging and endemic zoonoses in West Africa.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of Lassa virus ({LASV}) infections in rodent reservoirs and their endemic human caseloads remain poorly understood. During the endemic period, human infections are believed to be associated with the seasonal migration of Mastomys natalensis, thought to be the primary reservoir that triggers multiple spillovers of {LASV} to humans. It has become imperative to improve {LASV} diagnosis in rodents while updating their prevalence in two regions of Lassa fever endemicity in Nigeria. Rodents (total, 942) were trapped in Ondo (531) and Ebonyi (411) states between October 2018 and April 2020 for detection of {LASV} using various tissues. Overall, the {LASV} prevalence was 53.6\%. The outbreak area sampled in Ondo had three and two times higher capture success and {LASV} prevalence, respectively, than Ebonyi State. This correlated with the higher number of annual cases of Lassa fever ({LF}) in Ondo State versus Ebonyi State. All rodent genera (Mastomys, Rattus, Crocidura, Mus, and Tatera) captured in both states showed slightly variable {LASV} positivity, with Rattus spp. being the most predominantly infected (77.3\%) rodents in Ondo State versus Mastomys spp. (41.6\%) in Ebonyi State. The tissues with the highest {LASV} positivity were the kidneys, spleen, and testes. The finding of a relatively high {LASV} prevalence in all of the rodent genera captured highlights the complex interspecies transmission dynamics of {LASV} infections in the reservoirs and their potential association with increased environmental contact, as well as the risk of zoonotic spillover in these communities, which have the highest prevalence of Lassa fever in Nigeria. {IMPORTANCE} Our findings show the highest {LASV} positivity in small rodents ever recorded and the first direct detection of {LASV} in Tatera spp. Our findings also indicate the abundance of {LASV}-infected small rodents in houses, with probable interspecies transmission through vertical and horizontal coitus routes. Consequently, we suggest that the abundance of different reservoir species for {LASV} may fuel the epizootic outbreaks of {LF} in affected human communities. The high prevalence of {LASV} with the diversity of affected rodents has direct implications for our understanding of the transmission risk, mitigation, and ultimately, the prevention of {LF} in humans. Optimal tissues for {LASV} detection in rodents are also presented.},

	abstract = {Studying the social behaviour of small or cryptic species often relies on constructing networks from sparse point-based observations of individuals (e.g. live trapping data). A common approach assumes that individuals that have been detected sequentially in the same trapping location will also be more likely to have come into indirect and/or direct contact. However, there is very little guidance on how much data are required for making robust networks from such data. In this study, we highlight that sequential trap sharing networks broadly capture shared space use (and, hence, the potential for contact) and that it may be more parsimonious to directly model shared space use. We first use empirical data to show that characteristics of how animals use space can help us to establish new ways to model the potential for individuals to come into contact. We then show that a method that explicitly models individuals’ home ranges and subsequent overlap in space among individuals (spatial overlap networks) requires fewer data for inferring observed networks that are more strongly correlated with the true shared space use network (relative to sequential trap sharing networks). Furthermore, we show that shared space use networks based on estimating spatial overlap are also more powerful for detecting biological effects. Finally, we discuss when it is appropriate to make inferences about social interactions from shared space use. Our study confirms the potential for using sparse trapping data from cryptic species to address a range of important questions in ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus ({LASV}). It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of {LASV} focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new {LASV} strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested {PCR}-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage {IV}. In conclusion, {LASV} is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus {LASV}, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of {LASV} in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus {IgG} and {LASV}. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by {PCR}. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were {IgG} positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four {LASV} by {PCR} in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage {IV}, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of {LASV} in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

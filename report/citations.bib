	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: As of May 15, 2020, the United States has reported the greatest number of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) cases and deaths globally. Objective: To describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with {COVID}-19. Design: Cohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Setting: 154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states. Patients: 2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 during March 1-May 2, 2020. Measurements: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. Results: Ninety-two percent of patients had at least 1 underlying condition; 32\% required intensive care unit ({ICU}) admission; 19\% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15\% vasopressors; and 17\% died during hospitalization. Independent factors associated with {ICU} admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio ({aRR}) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex ({aRR} 1.34); obesity ({aRR} 1.31); immunosuppression ({aRR} 1.29); and diabetes ({aRR} 1.13). Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years ({aRR} 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex ({aRR} 1.30); immunosuppression ({aRR} 1.39); renal disease ({aRR} 1.33); chronic lung disease ({aRR} 1.31); cardiovascular disease ({aRR} 1.28); neurologic disorders ({aRR} 1.25); and diabetes ({aRR} 1.19). Race/ethnicity was not associated with either {ICU} admission or death. Limitation: Data were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were excluded. Conclusion: In-hospital mortality for {COVID}-19 increased markedly with increasing age. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe {COVID}-19-associated outcomes and define target groups for prevention and treatment strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The {PREDICTS} project—Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (www.predicts.org.uk)—has collated from published studies a large, reasonably representative database of comparable samples of biodiversity from multiple sites that differ in the nature or intensity of human impacts relating to land use. We have used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand the global status of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Despite its near pan-African range, the Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, carries the human pathogen Lassa virus only in West Africa, while the seemingly non-pathogenic arenaviruses Mopeia, Morogoro, and Luna have been detected in this semi-commensal rodent in Mozambique/Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Zambia, respectively. Here, we describe a novel arenavirus in M. natalensis from Gairo district of central Tanzania, for which we propose the name "Gairo virus". Surprisingly, the virus is not closely related with Morogoro virus that infects M. natalensis only 90km south of Gairo, but clusters phylogenetically with Mobala-like viruses that infect non-M. natalensis host species in Central African Republic and Ethiopia. Despite the evolutionary distance, Gairo virus shares basic ecological features with the other M. natalensis-borne viruses Lassa and Morogoro. Our data show that M. natalensis, carrying distantly related viruses even in the same geographical area, is a potent reservoir host for a variety of arenaviruses.},

	abstract = {The Cape ground squirrel Xerus inauris is unusual among social mammals as it exhibits a low reproductive skew, being a facultative plural breeder with not all females breeding within a group. We investigated pituitary function to assess whether there was reproductive inhibition at the level of the pituitary and potentially the hypothalamus in breeding and non-breeding female Cape ground squirrels. We did so during the summer and winter periods by measuring luteinizing hormone ({LH}) responses to single doses of 2g exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone ({GnRH}) and physiological saline administered to 42 females from {II} colonies. Basal {LH} concentrations of females increased in response to the {GnRH} challenge. Basal plasma {LH} concentrations were greater during winter, when most oestrus events are observed. However, we found no differences in plasma {LH} concentrations between breeding and non-breeding females. We showed that the anterior pituitary of non-breeding female ground squirrels is no less sensitive to exogenously administered {GnRH} than that of breeding females. We therefore concluded that the pituitary is no more active in breeding than non-breeding females. The lack of differentiation in response to {GnRH} suggests that either non-breeding females have ovaries that are less sensitive to {LH} or that they refrain from sexual activity with males through an alternative mechanism of self-restraint.},

	abstract = {African mole-rats (family: Bathyergidae) are strictly subterranean mammals that reside in extensive networks o underground tunnels. They are rarely, if ever, exposed to light and experience muted temperature ranges Despite these constant conditions, the presence of a functional circadian clock capable of entraining to externa light cues has been reported for a number of species. In this study, we examine a social mole-rat species Cryptomys hottentotus mahali, to determine if it possesses a functional circadian clock that is capable of perceivim light and ambient temperature cycles, and can integrate these cues into circadian rhythms of locomotor activiti and core body temperature. Eight male and eight female, non-reproductive individuals were subjected to sir cycles of varying light and temperature regimes. The majority of the individuals displayed daily rhythms o locomotor activity and body temperature that are synchronised to the external light and temperature cycles Furthermore, endogenous rhythms of both locomotor activity and core body temperature were displayed under constant conditions. Thus, we can conclude that C. h mahali possesses a functional circadian clock that car integrate external light and temperature cues into circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and core-body temperature.},

	volume = {221},
	issn = {0022-0949},
	abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis ({ICHH}) proposes that testosterone has both beneficial effects on male reproductive potential and negative effects by suppressing the immune system. However, support for the {ICHH} has been variable and an alternative hypothesis suggests that testosterone may be acting indirectly via cortisol to suppress immunity (the stress-linked {ICHH}). A third hypothesis is that increased energetic investment in immunity results in the suppression of testosterone. We tested these hypotheses in male Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) through two separate manipulations: first, by triggering a strong immune response using a lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) injection and, secondly, by increasing circulating testosterone using silastic testosterone implants. Responding to an immune challenge significantly reduced testosterone, supporting the immune suppression hypothesis, while increasing circulating testosterone had no effect on immunocompetence, body mass, ectoparasite abundances or cortisol levels, failing to support either the {ICHH} or stress-linked {ICHH}. Our results add to the increasing body of literature that challenges the {ICHH}, and we conclude that the trade-off between testosterone and immunity is mediated through immune activation and not through testosterone in male Cape ground squirrels. Being able to test the {ICHH}, stress-linked {ICHH} and immune suppression hypotheses in a free-ranging mammal gives us a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms mediating this trade-off.},

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus, an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.},

The main outcomes were the number of patients transferred to somatic care units, the number of deaths, and the number of patients developing a confusional state. The risk factors of confusional state and transfer to somatic care units were assessed by a multivariate logistic model. The risk of death was analyzed by a univariate analysis., {RESULTS}: In total, 350 patients were included in the study. Overall, 24 (7\%) were transferred to medicine units, 7 (2\%) died, and 51 (15\%) patients presented a confusional state. Severe respiratory symptoms predicted the transfer to a medicine unit [odds ratio ({OR}) 17.1; confidence interval ({CI}) 4.9-59.3]. Older age, an organic mental disorder, a confusional state, and severe respiratory symptoms predicted mortality in univariate analysis.

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care., {METHODS}: Data came from the registry data from the national {REgistry} of suspected {COVID}-19 in {EmeRgency} care ({RECOVER} network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the {US}. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department ({ED}) patients tested for {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50\% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables., {RESULTS}: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age{\textgreater}50 years, measured temperature{\textgreater}37.5degreeC, oxygen saturation{\textless}95\%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected {COVID}-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95\% {CI}: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6\% (94.8-96.3\%), specificity of 20.0\% (19.0-21.0\%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., {\textgreater}75\% probability with +5 or more points)., {CONCLUSION}: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.

            Background
            The {SARS}-{CoV}2 pandemic has caused high inpatient mortality and morbidity throughout the world. {COVID}19 convalescent plasma has been utilized as a potential therapy for patients hospitalized with {COVID}19 pneumonia. This study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalized {COVID}19 patients treated with {COVID}19 convalescent plasma in a prospective, observational multicenter trial.
          
          
            Methods
            From April 2020 through August 2020, hospitalized {COVID}19 patients at 16 participating hospitals in Colorado were enrolled and treated with {COVID}19 convalescent plasma ({CCP}) and compared to hospitalized patients with {COVID}19 who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Plasma antibody levels were determined following the trial given that antibody tests were not approved at the initiation of the trial. {CCP}-treated and untreated {COVID}19 hospitalized patients were matched using propensity scores followed by analysis for length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.
          
          
            Results
            542 total hospitalized {COVID}19 patients were enrolled at 16 hospitals across the region. A total of 468 hospitalized {COVID}19 patients were entered into propensity score matching with 188 patients matched for analysis in the {CCP}-treatment and control arms. Fine-Gray models revealed increased length of hospital stay in {CCP}-treated patients and no change in inpatient mortality compared to controls. In subgroup analysis of {CCP}-treated patients within 7 days of admission, there was no difference in length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.
          
          
            Conclusions
            These data show that treatment of hospitalized {COVID}19 patients with {CCP} did not significantly improve patient hospitalization length of stay or inpatient mortality.},

	abstract = {The transmission dynamics of the cowpox virus infection have been quantified in two mixed populations of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), through analyses of detailed time-series of the numbers of susceptible, infectious and newly infected individuals. The cowpox virus is a zoonosis which circulates in these rodent hosts and has been shown to have an adverse effect on reproductive output. The transmission dynamics within species is best described as frequency dependent rather than density dependent, contrary to the ‘mass action’ assumption of most previous studies, both theoretical and empirical. Estimation of a transmission coefficient for each species in each population also allows annual and seasonal variations in transmission dynamics to be investigated through an analysis of regression residuals. Transmission between host species is found to be negligible despite their close co–habitation. The consequences of this for the combining ability of hosts as zoonotic reservoirs, and for apparent competition between hosts, are discussed.},

	abstract = {More than 60\% of human infectious diseases are caused by pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals. Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people. Some of these diseases have only emerged recently. Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of {US} dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.},

	abstract = {In Africa, indigenous multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis) only appear to live commensally in houses when invasive black rats (Rattus rattus) are absent, yet little is known about the underlying mechanism. Avoidance through smell may cause the absence of M. natalensis from areas occupied by R. rattus, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested. We conducted a Y-maze choice experiment where 15 M. natalensis were offered a choice between corridors containing conspecific scent, R. rattus scent and a control scent. Residence time in the R. rattus corridor was greater than that in the control corridor but equal to that in the M. natalensis corridor, suggesting that multimammate mice do not actively avoid the scent of their invasive competitor.},

	abstract = {Many emerging infections are {RNA} virus spillovers from animal reservoirs. Reservoir identification is necessary for predicting the geographic extent of infection risk, but rarely are taxonomic levels below the animal species considered as reservoir, and only key circumstances in nature and methodology allow intrinsic virus-host associations to be distinguished from simple geographic (co-)isolation. We sampled and genetically characterized in detail a contact zone of two subtaxa of the rodent Mastomys natalensis in Tanzania. We find two distinct arenaviruses, Gairo and Morogoro virus, each spatially confined to a single M. natalensis subtaxon, only co-occurring at the contact zone’s centre. Inter-subtaxon hybridization at this centre and a continuum of quality habitat for M. natalensis show that both viruses have the ecological opportunity to spread into the other substaxon’s range, but do not, strongly suggesting host-intrinsic barriers. Such barriers could explain why human cases of another M. natalensis-borne arenavirus, Lassa virus, are limited to West Africa.},

	abstract = {Density-dependent shifts in population processes like territoriality, reproduction, dispersal, and parasite transmission are driven by changes in contacts between individuals. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about how contacts change with density, and thus the mechanisms driving density-dependent processes. A simple linear contact–density function is often assumed, but this is not based on a sound basis of empirical data. We addressed this question using a replicated, semi-natural experiment in which we measured contacts at feeding stations between multimammate mice, Mastomys natalensis, across ten distinct, linearly increasing densities between 10 and 272 animals/ha. Unexpectedly, unique contacts increased not linearly but sigmoidally with density, which we attribute to the species’ scramble competition mating system, small-scale dominance/avoidance and absence of territoriality. These results provide new insights into how species’ characteristics can relate to density-dependent changes in contacts, and the unexpected shape of the contact–density function warrants that density-dependence in ecological models, such as parasite transmission models, must be parameterized with care.},

	abstract = {1 The spatial and temporal scale at which infectious animals pose a transmission risk to others may be inferred by a study of space–time interaction in the clustering of cases of infection. 2 We analyse the distribution of bank voles and wood mice infectious with cowpox virus, using 7 years of monthly live-trapping data from a woodland in north-west England. 3 A published method, K-function analysis, is adapted to measure space–time interaction among infectious animals trapped on a grid system, where the populations at risk may vary in density. 4 We hypothesized that the risk of cowpox transmission from an infectious animal would be contained within a temporal scale of one infectious period and a spatial scale of one home-range diameter. 5 Cowpox cases among wood mice showed significantly greater spatial clustering than the population at risk at the smallest spatial scale, corresponding to animals caught in the same location. At larger scales, and for bank voles at all scales, cowpox cases showed no spatial clustering beyond that expected from an association with host distribution. 6 Cowpox cases among wood mice showed strong evidence of temporal clustering beyond that of the host population, indicating short-lived outbreaks. No such effect was apparent among bank voles. 7 Significant space–time interaction among cowpox cases was detected at the hypothesized spatial and temporal scales in both host species. This suggests that the risk of transmission is concentrated locally. 8 Results are discussed in terms of transmission, including consideration of the appropriateness of distance and nearest-neighbour based clustering tests to infections transmitted by local density and frequency dependent mechanisms.},

I'm unsure what to do with the team from Sierra Leone, they were included as co-authors on the prior chapter which uses much of the same data. Do I include them on this one too? Or because it is a "secondary analysis" of the same data do they not get included?

# Research questions 

This chapter will attempt to address the following questions.

  1. What is the prevalence of antibodies to Lassa fever among rodents in an endemic setting of Sierra Leone?
  2. Does the probability of contact among rodents vary by landuse type?
  3. Does the primary host of Lassa fever have variable inter- and intra-specific contact rates?

# Introduction

Lassa fever caused by *Lassa mammarenavirus* (LASV) is a rodent borne endemic zoonotic disease which is estimated to cause 100,000-900,000 annual infections across West Africa [@mccormick_prospective_1987; @basinski_bridging_2021]. Asymptomatic infection is common (up to 80%), although individuals who develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation have generally poor outcomes with mortality in this group reported as 17% [@mccormick_prospective_1987; @simons_lassa_2022]. Most reported cases are diagnosed in Nigeria, where the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) have rapidly expanded access to testing and implemented centralised reporting [@agbonlahor_52_2021]. Cases are sporadically reported from the Mano River Valley countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where testing is less available [@jetoh_epidemiological_2022; @shaffer_space-time_2021; @bausch_lassa_2001]. Within countries reporting Lassa fever cases there is important spatial clustering, typically from rural areas with previously identified outbreaks [@agbonlahor_52_2021]. Despite the observed spatial clustering of cases sero-epidemiological studies suggest infection is more widespread [@grant_seroprevalence_2023, @kerneis_prevalence_2009].  A seasonal component to Lassa fever outbreaks has also been observed, NCDC reports cases peaking in the first 3 months of the year, with low numbers of cases reported throughout the remainder of the year [@gomerep_epidemiological_2022]. This seasonal pattern is less pronounced in the Western endemic countries with no consistent seasonal association with peaks in reported cases [@shaffer_space-time_2021; @jetoh_epidemiological_2022].

Human infections are caused by pathogen spillover from rodent hosts, with a limited role of subsequent human-to-human transmission [@lo_iacono_using_2015]. The primary host, *Mastomys natalensis* is a commensal, native, rodent species present throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This species does not develop clinical symptoms following infection with LASV and are susceptible to low infectious doses consistent with what might be obtained from a wound caused by direct contact with an infected conspecific or indirect contact through contaminated environmental exposure [@safronetz_temporal_2022]. Viral RNA is detectable 3 days post infection, peaking within 1 to 2 weeks and resolving within 40 days. RNA persistance was observed in testes beyond this 40 day interval suggesting that prolonged sexual transmission may exist. The dynamics of antibody responses in infected rodents are not currently known. Based on a similar arenavirus (Morogoro virus), seroconversion is expected to occur 7 days post infection, with detectable antibodies remaining beyond the point where circulating RNA has declined [@borremans2015shedding]. A recent study conducted in Sierra Leone reported a prevalence of antibodies among rodents against LASV of 2.8% and a prevalence of LASV acute infection (using PCR) of 0.3% demonstrating the challenges of detecting acute infection [@bangura_lassa_2021].

While *M. natalensis* is considered the primary reservoir, 11 additional rodent species have been identified to be acutely or previously infected with LASV in endemic regions [@simons_rodent_2022]. The contribution of these species to pathogen spillover into human populations, and viral transmission or maintenance among rodent communities is unknown. Direct and indirect contact between rodents in species rich environments may produce incidental infections of non-reservoir species which are subsequently detected through surveillance activities, despite having little impact on viral transmission [@gilbert_deciphering_2013]. Alternatively, these species may facilitate transfer of this pathogen spatially, linking geographically isolated *M. natalensis* populations and causing reintroduction of virus into populations of the reservoir species [@cardenas_multiple_2022; @caron_bridge_2015]. It is therefore important to characterise rodent networks within endemic settings, expanding investigations to the entire rodent community rather than focussing on a single species' population [@albery_science_2021].

The composition of rodent community networks and potential interactions between rodent species in Lassa fever endemic regions has not been systematically reported. Previous studies provide summary descriptions only of wider rodent populations including measures of species richness and diversity which are limited to providing evidence of potential contact at a habitat level [@fichetcalvet_diversity_2010; @happi_increased_2022; @bangura_lassa_2021]. Additional information on the temporal and spatial overlap of individuals to infer potential for contact between individuals and importantly the risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including LASV, is important. Pathogens typically persist in dense, well-connected networks when frequency dependent transmission dominates [@begon_transmission_1999]. In discontinuous networks, pathogens with limited environmental transmission will become locally extinct out as the number of susceptible individuals is rapidly depleted [@almberg_parasite_2012-1; @swinton_persistence_1998]. We hypothesise that rodent contact rates, particularly among commensal rodent species would be greater in anthropogenically dominated habitats where nutritional resources are more concentrated than in other landuse types. We further hypothesise that spatial clustering of conspecifics and dominance of commensal species in these settings will lead to greater intra-specific contact rates compared to inter-specific contact rates. It is expected that rodent species with high contact rates will be associated with antibody positivity for LASV.

Here, we report the prevalence of antibodies against *Lassa mammarenavirus* among rodents in our study region. We reconstruct the contact networks of trapped rodents and identify the rate of contact between rodents in different landuse settings and the variability in inter and intra-specific contact rates. 

# Methods

## Study area

We conducted rodent trapping surveys between October 2020-February 2023 within and around four village study sites (Baiama; latitude = 7.8375, longitude = -11.2683, Lalehun; latitude = 8.1973, longitude = -11.0803, Lambayama; latitude = 7.8505, longitude = -11.1969, and Seilama; latitude = 8.1224, longitude = -11.1936) in the Lassa fever endemic zone of the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. Surveys were conducted within trapping grids along a landuse gradient of anthropogenic disturbance comprising, forest, agriculture (including fallow and currently in-use areas), and villages (within and outside of permanent structures). Trapping survey sessions within each village occurred four times annually with two trapping surveys in each of the rainy and dry seasons (May to November and December to April, respectively), giving a total of 9 trapping sessions over the study period.

Village study sites and trapping grids within the village study sites were selected to be representative of land use in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone and based on accessibility to the sites during all seasons and acceptability of the study protocol to the village study site communities. Supplementary Material 1 contains detailed information about the trapping process. Briefly, at each trapping grid 49 Sherman traps (7.62cm x 8.89cm x 22.86cm) (H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahasee, USA), were placed in a 7 trap by 7 trap grid, traps were placed 10 metres apart in a regular grid conforming to the local landscape (median trapping grid area = 4,813m^2^). For traps placed within permanent structures trap placement varied from this grid structure. Permanent structures were selected semi-randomly at each visit from a grid projected over the village area, with four traps placed within each structure. The location of each individual trap within trapping grids was geolocated for subsequent data processing. Traps were baited with a locally produced mixture of oats, palm oil and dried fish. Each morning the traps were checked and closed for the day prior to re-baiting during the evening. Each trapping survey session consisted of four consecutive trap-nights (TN) at each trapping grid within the village study site.

Trapped rodents were associated with the coordinates of the trap they were detected in. The `sf` package in the R statistical computing language (R version 4.1.2) was used for geospatial manipulation and analysis [@pebesma_simple_2018; @r_core_team_r_2021]. All rodent handling was performed by trained researchers, rodents were sedated with halothane and euthanised prior to obtaining morphological measurements and samples of blood and tissue following published guidance [@fichet-calvet_chapter_2014]. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethical Review Board and Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board of the Royal Veterinary College, United Kingdom (URN: 2019 1949-3), and Njala University, Sierra Leone. Carcasses were destroyed through incineration to eliminate the risk of onward pathogen transmission.

## Rodent species identification

Morphological taxonomic identification was performed in the field based on external characteristics using a taxonomic key, including external body measurements and physical characteristics, developed from Kingdon and Monadjem (Supplementary Material 2) [@kingdon_mammals_2013; @monadjem_rodents_2015]. Morphological identification alone is unable to distinguish some small-mammal species within the study area at species level. Therefore, molecular identification was performed on whole blood, tissue or dried blood spots. Samples were stored at -20°C until processing, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNAeasy kits as per the manufacturers instructions [@qiagen_dneasy_2023]. DNA extracts were amplified using platinum *Taq* polymerase (Invitrogen) and cytochrome B primers [@bangura_lassa_2021]. DNA amplification was assessed through gel electrophoreisis with successful amplification products undergoing Sanger sequencing. Attribution of obtained sequences to rodent species was through the BLAST programme comparing NCBI species records for rodent cytochrome B to our sample sequences (Supplementary Material 2) [@altschul_basic_1990].

## *Lassa mammarenavirus* serology

The BLACKBOX® LASV IgG ELISA Kit developed by the Diagnostics Development Laboratory hosted at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine and validated for rodent samples was used to determine serological status of trapped rodents [@gabriel_development_2018; @soubrier_detection_2022]. The full protocol is available as Supplementary Material 1. Briefly, 1 µL of whole blood was inactivated by mixing with the provided sample dilution buffer (1:50). Where whole blood was unavailable, blood was extracted from dried blood spots stored on filter paper by incubating with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.08% Sodium Azide and 0.05% Tween-20. Samples alongside negative and positive controls were incubated on the provided ELISA plates for 24 hours at 4-8 °C in a wet chamber. Following incubation, the plates were washed and incubated for a further hour with 1:10,000 diluted HRP-labelled streptavidin. A final wash was performed prior to the addition of 100µL of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate to wells, with incubation for 10 min. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by adding 100µL of a stop solution.

In a deviation from the kit protocol the optical density (OD) at 450nm and 630nm was measured (as opposed to 450nm and 620nm). The index value was produced from the OD difference (OD~450~-OD~630~) divided by the cut-off values (the mean values of the negative controls + 0.150). Samples were considered positive with index values greater or equal to 1.1, negative results less than or equal to 0.9, and inconclusive results when the index value lay between 0.9 and 1.1. Inconclusive results were repeated as advised by the kit manufacturers.

## Preparing rodent contact networks

Rodent contact networks were reconstructed from rodent trapping data. Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods have previously been used to identify space-sharing by individuals [@carslake_spacetime_2005; @clay_contact_2009; @wanelik_new_2022]. Within our system a CMR was not possible due to the risk of releasing an infected rodent back into human communities. We therefore consider that rodents experience direct or indirect contacts with other individuals through detections at trapping locations colocated in time and space [@perkins_comparison_2009]. We assumed these potential contacts were sufficient to transmit *Lassa mammarenavirus* if they were trapped within a buffer zone of 30m radius circle (2,828 m^2^) from the location of the trap during the same 4 trap night session. The 30m radius was selected to encompass the potential home range of an individual. An strong assumption underlying this approach is that an individual was trapped at the center of their home range [@wanelik_new_2022]. This buffer was applied to all species, further assuming that each species shared the same size home range. We assessed this second assumption using the `HomeRange` R package (version 1.0.2) [@broekman_homerange_2023]. Four of our identified species, and a further four species from genera of our trapped species are included in this resource. Selection of a 30m is supported as this contains the entirety of detected home ranges of individuals of **M. natalensis** our primary species of interest, and greater than 50% of the individuals of **Lemnisomys striatus**, **Mus musculus** and **Rattus rattus** (81%, 92% and 52% respectively) (Supplementary Figure 1.). Sensitivity analyses were performed using buffer areas of 15m and 50m. 

Species with fewer than 20 detected individuals were grouped for all network analyses as Other species. Networks were constructed from observed individuals (nodes) and the presence or absence of contacts between them (edges). We produced networks for each landuse type at each visit. Data were aggregated at landuse type and sampling visit producing a potential 28 distinct networks from 131 trapping grid, village and visit combinations. Only 25 networks were produced as there were no observed individuals in the remaining potential networks, primarily forest landuse settings.

Within our trapping grids only a subset of all possible rodents are detected in traps. Prior analysis of our study system suggests a probability of detection at each trap of less than 10% for 4 trap nights if the species is present in the trapping grid. Including unobserved individuals, and therefore unobserved contacts between these individuals aids fitting of models to observed data, by providing a measure of expected missingness. To estimate the abundance of individuals of each species within a trapping grid we used a N-mixture model to estimate population size from repeated count data using an N-mixture model implemented in the `unmarked` R package (version 1.2.5) [@royle_n-mixture_2004; @fiske_unmarked_2011]. The latent abundance distribution can be modelled as a Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson random variable. The abundance distribution was modelled with the number of trap nights and season as replicate dependent detection covariates in addition to location (whether a site was based in a rural or peri-urban setting) and landuse type (forest, agriculture or village) as occurrence covariates. To select the most appropriate model for each species, the AIC of each of the Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson model were compared, with the best fitting model used to derive the estimated abundance. The median estimated abundance at a trapping grid was then used to generate the unobserved individuals within each network aggregated to landuse type (Supplementary Figures 2A-F). The number of observed individuals was then subtracted from the estimated population size to derive the number of unobserved individuals of each species. These individuals were explicitly set to have missing (i.e., unobserved) edge values. 

Finally, the constructed adjacency matrices were converted to networks using the `network` R package (version 1.13.0.1) [@butts_network_2008]. We describe these inferred contact networks at landuse and visit level using network metrics including the number of nodes, the number of edges, the number of unobserved nodes and edges, median node degree and network density. Species level descriptions of the number of contacts by species and landuse are reported. Graphical representations of the inferred networks are shown in Supplementary Figure 3A-W.

## What is the association of landuse- and species-level heterogeneity on rodent contact networks?

To investigate whether landuse and species are associated with the probability of a contact between two individuals we model these contacts as Exponential-Family Random Graphs (ERGM) [@hunter_ergm_2008]. ERGMs implement maximum likelihood estimates to produce an Odds Ratio for the probability of an edge forming following the addition of a new node into a network based on network properties and nodal attributes. ERGMs were produced for each of our inferred contact networks to compare the probabilities of edges forming based on rodent characteristics (i.e., species). The general model term follows Equation 1.

$$
\log({\exp(\theta'g(y))}) = \theta_1g_1(y) + \theta_2g_2(y)+ ... + \theta_pg_p(y)
$$

Here $p$ is the number of terms in the model, the coefficients $\theta$ represent the size and direction of the effects of the covariates $g(y)$ on the overall probability of an edge forming in the network. At the edge level the expression for the probability of the entire graph can be re-expressed as the conditional log-odds of a single edge between two nodes (a contact between two rodents) as in Equation 2.:

$$
\operatorname{logit}P{(Y_{ij}=1|y^{c}_{ij})=\theta'\delta(y_{ij})}
$$

Here $Y_{ih}$ is the random variable for the state of the node pair $ij$ and $y^{c}_{i,j}$ signifies all dyads in the network other than $y_{i,j}$. $\theta'$ is the coefficient for the change production of an edge between the two nodes conditional on all other dyads remaining the same ($\delta(y_{ij}$). 

ERGMs are implemented using the `ergm` package (version 4.3.2) in R [@handcock_ergm_2022]. Three terms were included in the final ERGM to model the probability of the formation of ties (Equation 3.). The first term (edges), describes the density of the network, and is the probability of a tie being observed in the network. The second term (species), is the conditional probability of a tie forming conditional on the species of the new node. The third term (species homophily), is the conditional probability of a tie forming accounting for intraspecific tie formation among rodent individuals (i.e., the conditional probability of two individuals of the same species forming a tie). To reduce linear dependency of the nodal terms and due to data sparsity within our inferred networks all non-*M. natalensis* are grouped as "Other species" through the `levels` term.

$$
\text{Probability of tie}= \text{edges} + \text{species} + \text{species homophily}
$$

Models with unstable estimates for the species homophily term were not included in the random-effects meta-analysis. No contact networks from forest landuse contributed to meta-analysis as no *M. natalensis* were detected in these settings. Five models from agricultural settings and 6 from village settings were included in the meta-analysis. Random effects models were specified using the `metafor` package in R (version 3.8-1) [@viechtbauer_conducting_2010]. Effect sizes and standard errors for the three model terms were extracted. Weights for each network in the meta-analysis were assigned using inverse-variance weights. Two sensitivity analysis were performed first, by specifying a multi-level structure to the random-effects meta-analysis and second, by performing leave one-out meta-analysis [@cheung_guide_2019]. Forest plots were produced to visualise the summary Odds Ratio of the probability of a tie for each model term stratified by landuse type.   

# Results 

## Antibodies against *Lassa mammarenavirus* are detected in multiple rodent species within an endemic region

601 individual rodents were trapped from 37,982 trap-nights (TN). **12** species were identified from molecular classification, the majority of which were identified as *M. natalensis* (N = 75, 17.9%), *Lophuromys sikapusi* (N = 44, 10.5%) and *Mus musculus* (N = 41, 9.8%) (Table 1.).

Antibodies to *Lassa mammarenavirus* were identified in 20 (4.4%) rodents, including 7 *M. natalensis* (35%), 5 *Crocidura spp.* (25%), 3 *L. sikapusi* (15%) and 3 *Mus setulosus* (15%) (Table 1.). The highest proportion of positivity was observed in *Malacomys edwardsii* (N = 1, 12.5%), *M. natalensis* (N = 7, 9.3%) and *Mus setulosus* (N = 3, 8.6%).

Rodents with antibodies to *Lassa mammarenavirus* were detected in three of the villages, Lalehun (N = 11, 55%), Seilama (N = 8, 40%) and Baiama (N = 1, 5%) (Supplementary Table 1.). No positive rodents were detected in Lambayama. Among the villages with positive rodents the highest rates of positivity among trapped rodents was from Lalehun (10.1%), followed by Seilama (4.2%) and Baiama (2.2%). Positive rodents were detected during all study visits, the highest rate of positivity was observed during trapping conducted in June (N = 5, 8.6%), the lowest positivity rate was observed in November (N = 1, 2.2%) (Supplementary Table 2.). Most antibody positive rodents were trapped in agricultural settings (N = 13, 65%), followed by village (N = 6, 30%) and forest settings (N = 1, 5%). The rate of positivity was similar in both village and agricultural settings (4.9%) and lower in forest habitats (3.2%).

## Rodent contact networks

Networks situated in agricultural settings contained highest species richness (median = 10, IQR = 1), followed by village (median = 8, IQR = 1) and forest (median = 6, IQR = 0.5). More nodes were observed and predicted in agricultural landuse (median = 988, IQR = 118) than village (median = 447, IQR = 317) and forest (median = 163, IQR = 32.5) (Figure 1A.). The number of observed edges followed a similar pattern with a greater number of rodent contacts observed in agricultural settings (median = 38, IQR = 47) followed by village (median = 26, IQR = 19) and forest landuse (median = 3, IQR = 16.5) (Figure 1B.). Network density, was similar in village and agricultural settings (median = 0.06 and 0.09 respectively) but higher in forest settings (median = 0.44) where fewer individuals were observed.

The median degree (number of contacts) of a node were similar across all landuse types (Figure 2A.). Within forest landuse types no rodents had a degree greater than 6, the highest degree was 19 and 17 in agricultural and village landuse respectively. The median number of contacts did not differ importantly by species (Figure 2B.). Within species there was substantial variability in degree between individual rodents, for example, the median degree of *Praomys rostratus* in agricultural landuse was 3, although 3 individuals had a degree of greater than 15.

## The association of landuse- and species-level heterogeneity on rodent contact networks

Limiting the analysis of the probability of a contact being observed to the primary reservoir species of LASV, *M. natalensis*, resulted in 11 of the constructed networks being suitable for random effects meta-analysis. Four and 6 of these networks were produced from agricultural and village landuse respectively (Figure 3.). No forest landuse networks were suitable for analysis as no *M. natalensis* were detected in these settings. The odds of a contact being observed in these networks were generally low with similar odds across both agricultural (Odds Ratio = 0.08, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.04-0.13, *p* < 0.001) and village landuse (OR = 0.1, 95% C.I. = 0.06-0.16, *p* < 0.001). *Mastomys natalensis* had significantly reduced odds of forming a contact with another rodent in agricultural settings compared to other species (OR = 0.48, 95% C.I. = 0.26-0.9, *p* = 0.02). In village landuse types the odds of contact for *M. natalensis* was similar to other species (OR = 0.69, 95% C.I. = 0.4-1.19, *p* = 0.18). Compared to non-Mastomys species forming contacts this was statistically significantly lower in agricultural landuse types compared to village landuse types. *Mastomys natalensis* had a statistically significantly increased odds of having a contact with another individual of the same species compared to having contact with other species in agricultural settings (OR = 6.11, 95% C.I. = 2.7-13.8, *p* < 0.001) but not in village landuse types (OR = 2, 95% C.I. = 0.7-5.64, *p* = 0.19). The results of these meta-analysis showed a variable degree of heterogeneity. Substantial heterogeneity was reported in the odds of a contact being observed in the network (I^2^_agriculture_ = 94% and  I^2^_village = 82%) and a contact being observed for *M. natalensis* compared to other species (I^2^_agriculture_ = 70% and I^2^_village_ = 57%) for both landuse types. Heterogeneity in the analysis of the odds of a contect between individuals of *M. natalensis* was substantially lower (I^2^_agriculture_ = 9% and I^2^_village_ = 38%) in both landuse types. In sensitivity analysis the directions of these odds ratios did not vary in the first sensitivity analysis of altering the radius in which a contact was defined or in the second sensitivity analyses of leave one out random effects meta-analysis suggesting the results are robust to these two assumptions.

# Discussion

We investigated seropositivity among rodents detected within the LASV endemic region of Eastern Sierra Leone. We found low numbers of individuals with evidence of prior infection, from 5 rodent species. The majority of individuals with evidence of prior infection were individuals of the primary reservoir of this pathogen *M. natalensis*. We then constructed contact networks of detected individuals from location and temporal data. We found that networks were generally larger in both agricultural and village landuse with similar contact rates, these were both lower in forest landuse types. Finally, focussing on the primary LASV reservoir we identified that this species were less likely to form contacts with individuals of other species fairly consistently across landuse types but was more likely to come into contact with members of the same species in agricultural than in village landuse type. This is potentially important for the dynamics of pathogen transmission in these settings and suggests that pathogen transmission may occur at greater rates in agricultural landuse than village settings.

The number and proportion of seropositive rodents detected in the current study, while low (3.3%), was similar (2.8%) to that reported by another study performing systematic sampling of rodent populations in Eastern Sierra Leone [@bangura_lassa_2021]. The comparability between these studies is limited by the slightly different sampling design as we sampled rodents in forest environments and locations more distant from areas of human habitation. The proportion of all seropositive individuals that were *M. natalensis* (35%) was lower in our study than in the study conducted in the neighbouring district (75%) although the proportion of all *M. natalensis* that were antibody positive was more similar (7% compared to 8%). Compared with this other study we identified antibodies to LASV among two species, *Mus setulosus* and *Crocidura spp.*, but not *Praomys rostratus*. Our results support the previous studies findings that evidence of acute infection is present in multiple species within the Lassa fever endemic zone of Eastern Sierra Leone, similar to what has been reported elsewhere in West Africa (ref).

We found that while contact networks within forest settings were denser the networks contained fewer individual rodents and fewer species than agricultural settings were the number of number of individuals, the number of contacts and the number of contacts each individual made was greatest. Village landuse settings shared more similarities with agricultural landuse, although with fewer species detected. The number of species with individuals that made more contacts was greatest in agricultural settings with four species having individuals with more than 10 contacts, compared to village settings where only a single species (*Mus musculus*) had individuals with more than 10 contacts. None of the individuals of *M. natalensis* were identified to have more than 8 contacts.

*Mastomys natalensis* was found to have significantly fewer contacts than the other rodent species within the rodent communities in agricultural settings but not in village settings. When contacts were observed for this species in agricultural settings they were statistically signicantly more to be intra-specific contacts compared to contacts with other rodent species within the community. This was not replicated in village settings suggesting that co-occurrence with other species was more common in village settings. This may be important for viral transmission if other species are not as effective hosts for LASV replication and transmission. For example if an infected individual resides in an agricultural setting it is more likely to have a contact sufficient to transmit the pathogen to a susceptible conspecific than if that individual was located in village settings. This may result in a greater force of infection in agricultural settings where following viral introduction susceptible individuals are infected over a shorter timespan but that population level immunity is rapidly developed leading to local pathogen extinction. The same may not be the case in village settings where an infected rodent may not have a contact sufficient to transmit the pathogen to a susceptible conspecific. This may be complicated by migration of individuals between agricultural and village settings based on resource availability as has been reported in this species from studies conducted in Guinea (ref). The changing risk to human populations from outbreaks of Lassa fever is thus likely governed by contact among susceptible rodents in the local environment which may be dynamic.

We did not obtain a sufficient number of seropositive individuals to directly model the potential transmission networks of the pathogen through the rodent populations in these different landuse settings. Ideally transmission networks will be developed from acute infection data rather than seroprevalence. Based on prior results suggesting that fewer individuals would be PCR positive than seropositive it is unlikely that sufficient data would be available without dramatically increasing the amount of sampling periods and locations across the endemic region. Future studies will benefit from recent work estimating the population level seroprevalence to calculate the required trapping effort to obtain adequate sample sizes.



## Limitations and assumptions

  1. Rodent ranges and the concept of shared space use. Assuming that a rodent moves some distance X from its nest/home, it would spend a decreasing proportion of time in locations distal to this centre, with more time being sent in the central region. This is likely a simplification of their behaviour but will be used to illustrate the assumptions for contact. We trap this rodent at some point within this range. Whether it is trapped at the centre of its range or periphery is not known based on the observed data. We would need to have multiple captures and releases of a single individual in order to assess its true range. The subsequent buffering around this capture point and saying this is the rodents range is therefore a strong assumption. This is further complicated by including the same assumption for another rodent and saying that these rodents share a range and have a contact, rather than just some probability of a contact (which would be more truthful but difficult to estimate without intensive data on rodent movements). We will use a single assumption of range around a trapping point irrespective of species. This is unlikely to be true but there is no good data I have found on the range of the species we trap in the study sites.

  2. Missingness. We are not observing the entire rodent population that uses a trapping grid. The number of rodents that are trapped is likely a small subset of all those that are active in that space. This may also vary by species, time of the year and location. For example, *Mus musculus* may be more likely to enter a trap than  a *Praomys rostratus* so for the same trapping effort we would detect more *M. musculus*, leading to this species being over-represented in our sample and therefore contact network. Rodents may be more likely to enter a trap in periods of food scarcity, differential probability of detection by season could confound any inference on changing contact networks by season. Finally location is potentially important, a trap in the forest may be more or less likely to be entered than one in a home. Again, given a consistent trapping effort we may therefore observe an increased number of rodents in one of these locations that would result in our contact networks being denser or sparser than what they truly are. There may be a way we can understand these biases differently. First, we can assess the probability of detection using the methods in Chapter 3 across repeated trapping sessions. This could potentially help to understand whether we are more likely to detect a species during different conditions. Unfortunately this is at the species level rather than individual level. Second, we can estimate abundance of individuals in a trapping location. From this we can estimate the number of unobserved individuals and hence, the proportion of the population we are able to model. Any estimate of abundance will be poor and can only be treated as a very crude estimation.
  
  3. Contact. Beyond the probability and shared space approach we are introducing assumptions into contacts by the choice of definition. Lassa is transmitted through both direct and indirect means so contacts to not need to be both spatially and temporally overlapping. We are only observing rodents for 4 day periods so we do not have to worry too much about the temporal overlap. The spatial overlap issue is described above.
  
  4. Single observations. I have not found an article that uses single observations for this approach and the examples I have use Capture-Mark-Release (CMR) approaches. My interpretation of the limitation we have from single observations is that if there were other potential contacts for that individual we miss them if we are not trapping them over multiple observations. However, most studies trap for short periods of time and it is unclear how often they recapture the same individual, particularly for rodent studies. I am not really sure if this means that this approach is invalid.

  5. We did not alter buffer areas by species as. No were these homeranges obtained from studies conducted in West Africa or Sierra Leone. Rodent species may have different home ranges across their distribution.
  
## Mitigations

To mitigate the issues introduced in 1. and 3. I am intending on performing sensitivity analysis, changing the diameter around a trapped rodent at which we allow a contact to form. I would feel more confident in this approach if the probability of a contact between two individuals remains proportional based on the defined range. Any dramatic changes in the probability of a contact, in direction rather than magnitude, could be problematic. Missingness can be introduced into the modelling method if an estimate of abundance is possible. I am unsure how this will impact the probabilities of contacts but again I think sensitivity analysis would be useful to explore for this.

Rodents move around, their expected range is Xm. We set traps covering Ym^2 in different landuse types across 4 villages in Sierra Leone over Z trapping sessions. If a rodent was trapped within 50m of another rodent during the same trapping session we define this as a potential contact, either direct or indirect. We explore these networks of contacts through an ERGM approach to explore the probability of a contact between different species under different land-use conditions.
